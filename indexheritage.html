              The Red Fort, located in Delhi, is a historic monument that served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years, from 1639 to 1857. Built by Emperor Shah Jahan. The fort's massive red sandstone walls enclose a complex of palaces, halls, and gardens, including the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) and the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience). The Red Fort is not only a symbol of Mughal grandeur but also of India's struggle for independence, as it was from here that the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the national flag on August 15, 1947.
